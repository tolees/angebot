ℹ️:

- Live. Die. Repeat. – Death may seem inevitable as you progress through the story, but its not the end. With each death youll resurrect where it all started—and maybe learn a little about what happened here in the process. Escape this loop and discover the truth about the military facility and Willows past!
- Expect the Unexpected – Youll never know what comes next as you make your way through the military facility. Each floor will present a procedurally generated layout complete with new enemies to face and equipment to grab.
- Unlimited Power! – Dodge and parry enemy attacks with precision to build up Exo Force. When enough Exo Force is built up, unleash your ultimate power with Onslaught Mode and become temporarily invincible.
- Fully Armed and Operational – Youll encounter a veritable armada of mechanical foes in the mysterious military facility. Use a variety of weapons, take advantage of status effects, and power up with unique skills to take them down.
